# movies-webapp-react

Installation or Setup:

1. Download or Clone this project
2. Open with any editor you want. I prefer VS CODE :p
3. Then if it is VS CODE then use its terminal to write command or you can use any command line interface and for that you need to change your directory to that project directory.
4. Now, run command 'npm install' (without single quotes) and wait for installation of modules
5. Then run 'npm start' and it will pop with a browser and thats all ! Tadaaa !
